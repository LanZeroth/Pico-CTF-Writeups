Two's complement is a way to represent signed integers (both positive and negative) in binary. It's widely used in computer systems because it simplifies arithmetic operations. Here's an easy-to-understand explanation for beginners:

Key Concepts:
Positive numbers in two's complement are the same as regular binary representation.
Negative numbers are represented by inverting the bits (changing 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s) and then adding 1 to the result.
Steps to Find Two's Complement of a Number:
Write the number in binary.
Invert the digits (1s become 0s, and 0s become 1s).
Add 1 to the inverted binary number.
Example 1: Representing Positive Numbers
Let's represent 5 in an 8-bit system (8 digits).

First, convert 5 to binary:
5 in binary is 00000101.
No change is needed for positive numbers.
Thus, in two's complement, 5 is simply 00000101.

Example 2: Representing Negative Numbers
Let's represent -5 in two's complement (8-bit system).

Start with the binary representation of 5:

5 in binary is 00000101.
Invert all the bits (flip 1s to 0s and 0s to 1s):

11111010.
Add 1 to the inverted number:

11111010 + 1 = 11111011.
Thus, in two's complement, -5 is represented as 11111011.

Key Points:
Two's complement makes it easy to add and subtract numbers without needing separate subtraction rules.
The most significant bit (MSB) in two's complement determines the sign:
If the MSB is 0, the number is positive.
If the MSB is 1, the number is negative.
Example: Adding 5 and -5 in Two's Complement
Now, letâ€™s add 5 (00000101) and -5 (11111011):

Copy code
00000101
+ 11111011
------------
  00000000  (which is 0, as expected)
This shows how two's complement simplifies arithmetic, as the addition of 5 and -5 results in 0, just as with normal arithmetic.

Quick Summary:
Two's complement is used to represent both positive and negative integers.
Positive numbers are represented normally in binary.
Negative numbers are represented by inverting the bits and adding 1.
